AS the data came as an Excel\r\nspreadsheet, the first task was to extract it from the spreadsheet and store\r\nit into a more accessible format. I chose to store it as JSON objects in\r\nRiak. I then built a small Django application that creates charts based on\r\nthe data. The file structure reflects this:\r\n* The `dataload` directory contains a command line Java application that\r\n  uses [Apache POI](http://poi.apache.org/) to read the Excel file and then\r\n  loads the data into a [Riak](http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/)\r\n  database.\r\n* The `dataview` directory contains a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)\r\n  application that uses the Riak data to product graphs.\r\n\r\n![Application screen shot](http://brunogirin.github.com/wthack12/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\nany later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
